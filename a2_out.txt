Sorting Algorithms from the Best to the Worst based on their running times:
1) Heap Sort;
2) Merge Sort; 
3) Regular Insertion Sort;
4) Binary Insertion Sort;
5) Comparable Insertion Sort.

According to the chart in the normal scale, we can easily observe that all the plots 
for Insertion Sorts are similar to the quadratic plots. And log-log chart confirms our 
hypotheses, that is the running time of Insertion Sort is quadratic, since its plot in 
log-log are linear. Moreover, we can take a closer look at the code for Insertion Sorts. 
Each time, the loops iterates 1,2,3,â€¦, N times, in the worst case which shows that the 
running time is also O(N^2).
As for merge sort, it takes O(logN) times to split the array and O(N) times to merge the
subarrays together. Hence, the time complexity is O(NlogN). In terms of Heap Sort, we 
need logN times for each element to sink after we take out the maximum key, in the worst 
case and there are N elements indicating that the running time would also be O(NlogN). 
And from the log-log plot we can tell the plot for both merge sort and heap sort are 
linearithmic which confirms our hypotheses as well.
